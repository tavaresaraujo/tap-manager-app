# What is ngx-admin?

ngx-admin is a front-end admin dashboard template based on Angular 8+, Bootstrap 4+ and <a href="https://hubs.ly/H0n5PMl0" target="_blank">Nebular</a>. That means all the data you can see on graphs, charts and tables is mocked in Javascript so you can use the backend of your choice with no limitations.

## How can it help me?

We believe that at the moment a lot of business applications have administration/management interfaces inside of them. Sometimes it’s not that obvious, but a lot of web applications have dashboards with panels, charts analytics, etc.


ngx-admin aims to bootstrap the development of your product and provide an ecosystem for building production-ready application or prototypes.

Frameworks like Bootstrap provide a number of components, but usually it’s not enough to build a real-world app. This template comes with lots of popular UI components with a unified color scheme, plus it is based on a modern Angular framework and has a flexible component based structure.

You can also use ngx-admin for the purpose of learning Angular.
